# Pushing Matplotlib to the Limit: A QASM Circuit Explorer

While working at **SoftwareQ**, I developed a bespoke visualization tool designed to make debugging large quantum circuits intuitive. The challenge was to build a highly interactive interface without relying on heavy external GUI frameworks—using strictly **Matplotlib**.

The result is a lightweight yet robust viewer that parses and renders **any possible QASM operation**. I implemented custom event handling to allow users to drag the canvas and zoom in on specific gate sequences with precision. To assist with navigation in deep circuits, I built an interactive **minimap** in the bottom-left corner, featuring a draggable "view rectangle" that controls the main display, mimicking the UX of professional EDA tools.
