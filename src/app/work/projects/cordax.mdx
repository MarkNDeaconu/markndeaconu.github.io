# Automating the Impossible: The Cordax Project

I joined this project about a month ago, after a group of engineering friends from Queen's approached me with a proposition. They claimed that building their startup's core product involved solving a problem so technically difficult, it was likely impossible for me to crack.

Looking back, this was obvious bait to extract free labor from me. But the trap worked perfectly, I was hooked immediately.

### The Disconnect
The team had identified a massive inefficiency in how residential properties are built compared to commercial ones.

In commercial construction, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems get the full treatment: 3D CAD models and comprehensive tech suites. In residential construction, these systems are often hand-drawn by an engineering consultant and then promptly ignored by the general contractor in favor of "eyeballing it."

And honestly? I don't blame them. The horror stories we've heard from job sites reveal a huge disconnect between approved initial plans and what can physically be built once real-world constraints (like a load-bearing wall appearing where it shouldn't be) are introduced.

**Enter Cordax:** A living document for residential construction that automatically routes HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems around obstacles in real-time.

### How We Built It
To turn "eyeballing it" into an algorithm, we had to digitize the intuition of a master builder.

* **The Blueprint:** We start by ingesting architectural diagrams of each floor to establish the layout.
* **Computer Vision:** We utilize CV and manual annotations to identify key constraints (structural walls, joists, vents, sinks, etc.).
* **The Algorithm:** This is proprietary, but contact our company if you are interested and we can discuss!

### The Human Challenge
The math was hard, but the human element was harder.

The general contractors in our pilot program have been in the business for 20+ years. They have unique, deeply ingrained methods for approaching construction. They didn't want a program that told them the mathematically "optimal" route; they wanted software that adapted to how *they* think.

Marrying their intuition with our mathematical models has been our biggest hurdle.

### The Solution: Modular Weighting
Our breakthrough came from parameterizing the *algorithm*.

We realized that the method we used allowed a large degree of customization. By adjusting the parameters, we could personalize the route without changing the algorithm.

Now, instead of forcing a contractor to build "our way," we simply tune the algorithm to reflect their preferences, allowing the math to solve the problem exactly how they would, just a whole lot faster.
