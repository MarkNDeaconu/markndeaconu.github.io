# The Silicon Obsession: Building, Breaking, and Fixing PCs

All through high school, my main source of income, and my primary obsession, was building and repairing computers. This journey began in 2016, when my father bought me a set of components for my birthday, hoping we could share a nice father-son bonding experience.

It turned out to be much harder than either of us expected. But after a series of frantic builds, rebuilds, and troubleshooting sessions, we finally got the system to POST. I was elated. That single moment changed the trajectory of my life; it was the first time I seriously questioned my sole dedication to mathematics, making room for a lasting fascination with hardware.

### Trial by Fire (and Dust)

To date, I’ve completed over **40 custom builds** and resurrected 6 machines that were in catastrophic condition. It has been a wild ride, and my competence was earned through a series of "learning experiences" that range from painful to explosive:

* **The Health Hazard:** I once contracted bronchitis for weeks after inhaling an ungodly amount of dust from vintage PC parts. (I can’t even explain how I let it get that bad, but the next point might offer a clue.)
* **The Scrapyard Hunt:** I once dragged my poor mother to a scrapyard to hunt for motherboards with bent pins. I was convinced I could save them. I never fixed a single one. Sorry, Mom.
* **The Explosion:** My brother’s girlfriend gifted me an old power supply from her school. I plugged it in, and it fully exploded. Lesson learned.
* **The "Treasure":** My high school robotics professor donated 30 old Nvidia Quadro GPUs to my cause. I thought I struck gold, until I realized they were effectively ancient paperweights.
* **The Salvage:** I was gifted a Bitcoin mining rig, which I promptly destroyed just to harvest the high-end power supplies inside.

### Takeaway

I cherish the time I've spent tinkering with silicon. I have made just about every mistake imaginable, but each short circuit and blue screen has deepened my understanding and improved my ability to troubleshoot.

These days, I’m the go-to guy for friends and family needing repairs, and I’m always happy to talk shop with anyone looking to learn more about what goes on inside the case.
