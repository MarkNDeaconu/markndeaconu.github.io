## Story

All through high school, my main source of income came from building and selling PCs. This passion started in 2016, when my father bought me a set of computer parts for my birthday, hoping we could build one together. It turned out to be much harder than we expected. After a series of builds and rebuilds, we finally got the PC to POST, and I was elated.  

That moment really changed the course of my life, because it was the first time I questioned my sole dedication to math. From then until now, I've had a lasting obsession with computers.  

## Fun Experiences

To date, I've built over 40 PCs and repaired 6 that were in catastrophic condition. It's been a wild ride, complete with some funny stories:  

1. I got bronchitis for weeks after inhaling too much dust from old PC parts.  
   (I can't even explain this one, but maybe the next story gives some context.)  

2. I once dragged my mom to a scrapyard to help me look for motherboards with bent pins.  
   (I never managed to fix a single one. Sorry, Mom.)  

3. My brother's girlfriend gave me an old power supply from her school, and it fully exploded when I plugged it in.  

4. My high school robotics professor gave me 30 old Nvidia Quadro GPUs.  
   (They kinda sucked.)  

5. I was gifted a Bitcoin mining rig, which I promptly destroyed just to harvest the power supplies.  

## Takeaways

I really cherish the time I've spent working on computers. I've probably made just about every mistake imaginable, but each one has deepened my understanding and improved my ability to help others. These days, I'm always happy to work on computers for friends and family, and I enjoy talking with anyone who wants to learn more.
