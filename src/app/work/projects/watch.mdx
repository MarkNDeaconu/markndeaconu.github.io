## Story

For years I've loved automatic watches. It was so cool to me that although there have been technological improvements to timekeeping mechanicsms, that there is still such a strong community behind mechanical based watches. The craftsmanship that expert level watch makers bring to the table is not something very common to see in this age of automation. I thought that in order to increase my appreciation of the art of watch making, I could try my hand at it.

## Getting started

It's easier than every to get started with watchmaking given the tools that are available to us now. On aliexpress you can pick up genuine seiko movements and parts, as well as replica or custom dials and cases. For most of my builds I ended up going with a simple movement called the Seiko NH-35, this is a beginners movement thats very easy to get started with.
