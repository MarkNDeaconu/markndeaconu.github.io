# Portraits in the Park: A Summer of Art, Community, and Viral Kindness

This summer, my girlfriend and I embarked on a passion project aimed at giving back to the community we grew up in. 

The beautiful Toronto summer has always been the perfect backdrop for our shared hobbies. Jasmine is definitely the artist, while I lean more towards the "crafts" and technical side, so we have a lot of fun combining our talents. Jasmine’s art has flourished in recent years, so we decided to try an experiment: drawing portraits of strangers in the park to see their reactions. 

She suggested charging a single dollar for the service, and I was immediately on board.

### From the Park to the Feed

After seeing the genuine joy her portraits sparked in people, I decided to document these interactions on video. As we began posting them to social media, the reaction was instant. We garnered thousands of views within days, which inspired us to return to the park as often as possible. 

The momentum was unstoppable. After hitting **millions of total views**, our small park project evolved into something much bigger. We began receiving invitations from charities asking if we could help raise funds at their events.

### Art for a Cause

For the first time, Jasmine allowed people to pay whatever they wished for a portrait, with 100% of the proceeds going to charity. 

The results were incredible. Her work raised **thousands of dollars** for the Toronto Humane Society, animal adoption initiatives, and cancer research. The project took us all over the province—from hackathons and restaurant openings to fashion shows and sports matches.


### The Front Page

The most surreal moment arrived when a journalist from *The Globe and Mail* reached out to do a story on Jasmine and the community impact of her events. 

As a lifelong reader of the *Globe*, I nearly died of excitement. In a typical "me" moment, my first thoughts were, of course, about myself—how cool I’d look in the newspaper and what I should wear. 

But eventually, I cooled down and realized the truth: I didn’t do much other than point a camera at my community and at Jasmine’s brilliant talent. Looking back, those moments spent filming and photographing the joy of strangers were some of the best of my life. It’s not every day you get to witness that much love.

**P.S.** It actually made the national front page! Sharing the page with the Prime Minister is pretty good company for Jas. 😂

> "That hot August day, Ms. Boyd matched the energy of each person who sat across from her, never showing signs of a depleting social battery. Her partner, Mark Deaconu, said it’s no surprise so many came out to support her. It’s not just her art that attracts people, he explained, but also her approachable, warm demeanour."
